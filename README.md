# tld_territory
A pygame program that simulates spreading territory.

Not gonna lie, this has to be the most complicated python program I've ever written yet. So complicated it's kinda hard for me to explain what I have here but I'll try my best. 
In this program, if you place a red/blue tile using the Q/E key, it will automatically spread to other tiles. It can not spread to wall tiles which you can place by clicking on an empty tile. It's a pretty cool think to watch.
You can increase the grid size by changing a couple variables but be warned, anything higher then the values I preset will cause the program to slow to a crawl during intensive times.

To play this, just run main.py or run the .exe. The exe is standalone, so it does not need any other files to work.

Overall, is there anything I could've done better? Thank you for using this program!
